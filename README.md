# FanxPal

**FanxPal** is a personal site that shares the simple things I genuinely enjoy — from lo-fi music and trading systems, to travel stories, home cooking, gardening, and digital tools that make life better.

This website is built with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and it's where I publish:
- 🎧 Music I make and love (mostly lo-fi / chill beats)
- 📈 Trading ideas and systems that actually work
- ✈️ Travel stories from places that inspire me
- 🍳 Simple recipes and cooking experiments
- 🌱 Gardening notes and slow-living ideas
- 📱 Tech tools that improve productivity and focus

If you're someone who likes real stuff that works — maybe you'll like it too.
